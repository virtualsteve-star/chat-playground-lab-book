# Lab Book Index

Welcome to the hands-on learning experience for LLM/Gen AI security concepts! This lab book provides structured guidance through various security challenges and defensive techniques.

## About This Lab Book

These labs accompany the [Chat Playground project](https://github.com/virtualsteve-star/chat-playground), which provides hands-on experience with LLM/Gen AI security concepts. You can approach this learning in two ways:

1. **Free-form exploration**: Play with the [deployed demo](https://virtualsteve-star.github.io/chat-playground/) directly
2. **Structured learning**: Follow this lab book for guided exercises

Each lab includes several exercises with varying skill levels and prerequisites. Some exercises are basic and require no special skills, while others benefit from developer knowledge. Many exercises can be completed for free, while some require API keys for external services. We've clearly labeled each exercise so you can choose what's right for you.

## Skill Level Guide

- **Level 1**: No special skills required - anyone can complete these
- **Level 2**: Some sysadmin or developer experience helpful, but not required
- **Level 3**: Requires moderate developer skills - more challenging exercises

## Prerequisites

The most common prerequisite is an OpenAI API key for exercises that use real LLM services. These exercises typically cost only a few pennies worth of tokens.

## Lab Overview

### [Lab 1: First Steps - Meet Your Digital Companions](lab1-firststeps/)
Get acquainted with the playground environment and meet Eliza, a simple local chatbot. Learn about the project structure and understand how basic chatbots work.

### [Lab 2: Broken Bot - When Good Bots Go Bad](lab2-brokenbot/)
Explore what happens when chatbots lack proper guardrails. Meet Oscar, a deliberately problematic bot, and learn how to implement basic content filtering.

### [Lab 3: Locking the Front Door and Back Door - Defense in Depth](lab3-defenseindepth/)
Master prompt injection attacks and learn to defend against them. Discover how to prevent code generation exploits and implement comprehensive security measures.

### [Lab 4: Simple vs. Smart - AI-Powered Security](lab4-simplevssmart/)
Compare local rule-based filters with AI-powered moderation systems. Learn about automated testing and evaluation of security measures.

### [Lab 5: Go Bananas - Advanced Customization](lab5-gobananas/)
Dive into advanced customization and create your own security filters. Build PII detection systems and expand the playground's capabilities. **Note: All exercises in this lab require Level 3 skills.**
