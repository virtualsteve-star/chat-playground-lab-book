# Chat Playground Lab Book

A comprehensive, hands-on learning resource for LLM/Gen AI security concepts. This lab book provides structured guidance through **17 hands-on exercises** covering various security challenges and defensive techniques using the [Chat Playground](https://github.com/virtualsteve-star/chat-playground) project.

## About This Project

The Chat Playground Lab Book is designed to complement the [Chat Playground](https://github.com/virtualsteve-star/chat-playground) - an interactive web application that demonstrates LLM security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms. While you can explore the playground freely, this lab book provides a structured learning path for those who prefer guided exercises.

## What You'll Learn

This lab book covers essential LLM security concepts through **17 comprehensive exercises**:

- **Basic chatbot security** - Understanding how simple rule-based systems work
- **Content filtering** - Implementing guardrails to prevent inappropriate outputs
- **Prompt injection attacks** - Recognizing and defending against manipulation attempts
- **Code generation exploits** - Preventing unauthorized code execution
- **AI-powered moderation** - Comparing simple vs. sophisticated security approaches
- **Custom security filters** - Building your own detection systems

## Lab Structure

The lab book is organized into 5 progressive labs with **17 total exercises**, each with multiple skill levels:

1. **[First Steps](index.html#labs)** - Get acquainted with the playground environment (3 exercises)
2. **[Broken Bot](lab2.html)** - Explore what happens without proper guardrails (4 exercises)
3. **[Defense in Depth](lab3.html)** - Master prompt injection defense (4 exercises)
4. **[AI-Powered Security](lab4.html)** - Compare local vs. AI moderation (3 exercises)
5. **[Advanced Customization](lab5.html)** - Create your own security filters (3 exercises)

## Skill Levels

Exercises are designed for different skill levels:
- **Level 1**: No special skills required - anyone can complete these
- **Level 2**: Some sysadmin or developer experience helpful
- **Level 3**: Requires moderate developer skills - more challenging exercises

## Getting Started

1. **Try the Playground**: Visit the [live Chat Playground demo](https://virtualsteve-star.github.io/chat-playground/)
2. **Read the Lab Book**: Start with the [Index](index.html) to get an overview
3. **Choose Your Path**: Pick exercises that match your skill level and interests

## Prerequisites

Most exercises can be completed for free. Some advanced exercises require:
- An OpenAI API key (costs only a few pennies worth of tokens)
- Basic development environment (for Level 3 exercises)
