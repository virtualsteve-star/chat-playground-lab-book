            <h2>Lab Overview</h2>
            <p>In this lab, you'll compare local filters with AI-powered moderation. You'll learn about advanced prompt injection techniques and automated testing for security measures. This lab focuses on understanding the trade-offs between simple and sophisticated approaches.</p>

                    <p>Repeat your activities from Lab 2, but switch between the local Sex/Violence filters and the "AI" version. Try things like misspellings. Compare the local and AI versions. Note the performance changes. Look for changes when entering your prompts or getting responses.</p>

                    <p>Repeat your attempts from Lab 3 to do a prompt injection. Now turn on local, and see what it blocks. Then, uncheck "Prompt Injection (Local)" and check the "Prompt Injection (AI)" filter. Try things like prompt injections that include misspellings and foreign languages. See how it compares.</p>

                    <h5>Directions:</h5>
                    <p>Let's see how these work and compare. It's one thing to hunt and peck, but having a real evaluation suite is crucial. Navigate to the playground's live "Test Suite". Try the PromptInjection, sex and violence test suites. These may take a few minutes to run (and may also cost a few pennies). When they complete, they'll give you a summary that shows speed/performance as well as accuracy. Note the variations.</p>
