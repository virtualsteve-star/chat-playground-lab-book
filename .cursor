# Chat Playground Lab Book - Jekyll + GitHub Pages Setup

This project uses Jekyll to generate a static site from Markdown files, deployed via GitHub Pages.

## File Structure
- `index.md` - Homepage (served as index.html)
- `lab1-firststeps.md` through `lab5-gobananas.md` - Individual lab pages
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration
- `_layouts/default.html` - HTML template for all pages
- `README.md` - Repository documentation (DO NOT RENAME OR DELETE)

## Important Rules
1. **NEVER rename or delete README.md** - This file must remain as README.md
2. All markdown files must have proper front matter with `layout: default` and `title`
3. Internal links should use `.html` extensions (Jekyll converts .md to .html)
4. The `Chat Playground Lab Book.md` file is excluded from Jekyll processing (spaces in filename)

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- Source: Deploy from a branch (main branch)
- Build tool: GitHub Actions (Jekyll)
- Base URL: `/chat-playground-lab-book`
- Custom domain: None

## Troubleshooting
- If 404 errors occur, check that index.md has proper front matter
- Ensure all markdown files have front matter with layout and title
- Verify internal links use .html extensions
- Check GitHub Pages settings for build errors

## Development Workflow
1. Edit markdown files with proper front matter
2. Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve` (if Jekyll is installed)
3. Commit and push changes
4. Wait for GitHub Pages to rebuild (usually 2-5 minutes)
5. Test the live site

## Best Practices
- Keep Jekyll configuration simple
- Use consistent front matter across all pages
- Test links after deployment
- Monitor GitHub Pages build logs for errors

## Project Overview
This is a markdown-based lab book for LLM/Gen AI security concepts that renders beautifully on GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

## Key Technologies
- **Markdown** - All content is written in markdown format
- **Jekyll** - GitHub Pages uses Jekyll to render markdown into HTML
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting platform that automatically builds and serves the site

## Important Notes
- All content should be written in markdown, not converted to HTML
- Jekyll automatically converts markdown to HTML with the custom layout
- GitHub Pages serves the site at: https://virtualsteve-star.github.io/chat-playground-lab-book/
- The `_config.yml` excludes `PROJECT_README.md` from being processed as a page
- Navigation links use `.html` extensions (Jekyll converts markdown to HTML)

## Styling
The `_layouts/default.html` provides:
- Clean, modern typography
- Responsive design
- Navigation bar
- Consistent styling across all pages
- Links to GitHub repository and Chat Playground

## Remember
- Keep using markdown for all content
- Don't convert to static HTML
- Let Jekyll handle the rendering
- Test changes by visiting the live site after pushing
